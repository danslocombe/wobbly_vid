I'm going to talk a bit about these planets from my game Crunda 
They were the first thing I made in development
Dictated where the rest of the game went

They wobble and interact with the world, and kind of make the whole experience come alive
as I just between them.

They are modelled physically with a fairly standard technique, perlin noise
I want to encourage you to look at standard methods and see if you can find your own twists



----- Into maths world


1 d perlin noise
you can have multidimensional but we are just generating a simple surface
sample points and draw lines between them

doesnt look very good

add octaves and sum together
you get "larger" features from lower octaves and finer grained details from higher octaves
"fractal" perlin noise
